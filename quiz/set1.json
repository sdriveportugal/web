    "optionA": "Only use the service brake.",
    "optionB": "Use the engine as a brake booster to increase speed.",
    "optionC": "Use the engine as a brake aid.",
    "Answer": "C",
    "Explanation": "The service brake is the brake that you use with your foot by pressing one of the three pedals. Using the engine as a brake aid is when you are braking thºe vehicle with the service brake and at the same time you are shifting gears to match the speed of the vehicle to help you brake. When a gear is engaged, the movement of the wheels and the engine are somewhat linked. If you engage a gear lower than the one you're currently travelling in, the vehicle tends to slow down (even if you don't use the service brake). So you can and must use the engine as a braking aid as it reduces speed without running the risk of skidding, which would be a serious possibility in the situation in the picture."
