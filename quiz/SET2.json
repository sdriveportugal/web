    "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdriveportugal/web/refs/heads/main/SetPics/SET1/783.png",
    "optionA": "The light system of the immobilised vehicle is faulty",
    "optionB": "The immobilised vehicle is not visible from 200 metres",
    "optionC": "The vehicle or load immobilised on the carriageway, are not visible from 100 metres away.â€™",
    "Answer": "C",
    "Explanation": "If the vehicle is immobilised on the public road, we must place the triangle at least 30m from the rear of the vehicle so that the same triangle is visible to others at least 100m.  We need to give other drivers enough time to react. All Light and Heavy vehicles must be equipped with the triangle. Failure to use this sign is a serious offence. The IMT didn't formulate the question very well: it's not the vehicle or load that has to be visible from 100 metres away, it's the triangle that has to be visible from at least 100 metres away and cannot be less than 30 metres from the obstacle."

    "Answer": "C",
    "Explanation": "When you are not told in the image, question or answers which direction the vehicles are going, you must assume that they are going straight ahead. In this case, you are only told that our vehicle is going to change direction to the right, so all the others are going straight ahead. As we're changing direction to the right, there's nothing to stop us from making the manoeuvre. The vehicle on our left has to give way to us and we're not going to interfere with the vehicle on the right (at the junction), so we can go ahead."

When these arrows are placed within lanes separated by continuous lines, they indicate that drivers must follow the direction shown by the arrow. For example, if the arrow points left, vehicles in that lane are required to turn left if it points straight and right, vehicles can either proceed straight or turn right. There might be an earlier arrow (before reaching the crossroads or junction) with the same configuration that acts as a warning. This earlier arrow helps to notify drivers in advance about the upcoming traffic directions or lane restrictions, allowing them to choose the correct lane ahead of time."
